# Image-Manipulation-Detection
Digitally generated images serve as important evidence in various fields, influencing pivotal decisions and legal proceedings. However, ensuring the integrity of these images is paramount to uphold the trustworthiness of the information presented. Various image manipulation techniques, such as splicing, copy-move, object removal, and compression, can distort the authenticity of images. Accurately identifying manipulated images poses a significant challenge, yet the residual traces left behind by such alterations contribute significantly to their detection. In order to improve accuracy, we introduce IMDnet, a lightweight CNN-based model, complemented by a preprocessing layer that utilizes Smooth filtering and Error Level Analysis techniques to optimize input data by augmenting the network's discriminative capabilities. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation on benchmark datasets, including different forms of image manipulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Our model demonstrate 96.13\% accuracy on CASIA dataset and 97.07\% accuracy on 140K RFF Dataset that indicates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques, achieving higher accuracy and robustness in detecting various forms of image manipulations.
